# LaTeX listings style for Racket programs
LaTeX code for (simple) syntax highlighting of the Racket programming language using the `listings` package.

## Usage
Download the only LaTeX file in this repository. In your preamble, include it with `\input{racket-lang.tex}`. You can now use `\begin{lstlisting}[language=racket]` to typeset Racket code. The LaTeX file also defines a command `\ir{...}` for *i*nline *R*acket code.

## Example
This is a screenshot of the PDF generated by the LaTeX/Racket code below it.

The Racket code defines an abstract datatype for lambda expressions, and a procedure to check whether a variable occurs free in one. This example is copied from p. 46 of the book *Essentials of Programming Languages (3rd ed.)* by Friedman & Wand.
```latex
\begin{lstlisting}[language=racket]
	;; Lambda calculus expressions
	(define-datatype lc-exp lc-exp?
		(var-exp
			(var symbol?))
		(lambda-exp
			(bound-var symbol?)
			(body lc-exp?))
		(app-exp
			(rator lc-exp?)
			(rand lc-exp?)))
	
	;; occurs-free? : Symbol * Lc-exp -> Bool
	(define occurs-free?
		(lambda (search-var exp)
			(cases lc-exp exp
				(var-exp (var) (eqv? var search-var))
			(lambda-exp (bound-var body)
				(and
					(not (eqv? search-var bound-var))
					(occurs-free? search-var body)))
			(app-exp (rator rand)
				(or
					(occurs-free? search-var rator)
					(occurs-free? search-var rand))))))
\end{lstlisting}
```
